# Time-Series Data Handling for Synchrophasor Data

This project focuses on efficiently handling large volumes of time-series data, specifically synchrophasor data from voltage streams in cities such as Mumbai, Delhi, Kharagpur, and Chennai. The goal is to optimize the storage and retrieval of statistics (sum, mean, min, max) over a range of values for this high-volume data, which can reach up to 2 billion data points per second.

## Project Overview

### Problem Domain

- **Synchrophasor Data**: Each data stream consists of timestamp and float value pairs representing voltage readings from power grid devices deployed across multiple cities.
- **Data Volume**: Each data stream can produce billions of data points per second, so efficient retrieval of statistics over a range is crucial.
- **Task**: Implement a data structure that enables efficient queries for simple statistics (sum, mean, min, max) over specific ranges of data.

### Key Objectives

- **Efficient Retrieval**: Design a data structure that can handle large-scale time-series data and optimize for fast queries on statistical operations (sum, mean, min, max).
- **Storage Optimization**: Ensure that the solution uses memory efficiently while being capable of handling millions of data points.
- **Range Queries**: The solution must allow for efficient range queries on the data streams for real-time situational awareness.

### Tasks

- **Data Stream Representation**: Represent the voltage data streams as time-series objects that store timestamp-value pairs.
- **Efficient Storage Structure**: Implement an efficient data structure, such as a segment tree or a sliding window, to store the data in a way that supports fast statistical queries.
- **Query Support**: Implement methods to retrieve statistics like sum, mean, min, and max over a range of timestamps in O(log n) or O(1) time complexity.
- **Performance Testing**: Benchmark the data structure to handle the high-volume data streams and test its efficiency for real-time queries.

### Key Considerations

- **Scalability**: The solution should scale to handle the volume of data generated by synchrophasor devices in real-time.
- **Time Complexity**: Aim for O(log n) or better time complexity for range queries and updates to the data structure.
- **Memory Efficiency**: Ensure that the data structure does not consume excessive memory, despite handling large amounts of data.

## Technologies

- **Python**: The implementation of the data structure and statistical queries will be done in Python.
- **Data Structures**: Segment Trees, Binary Indexed Trees, or Sliding Window for efficient range queries.
- **Benchmarking Tools**: Use profiling tools to measure and optimize performance.

## How to Use

- **Input Data**: Provide the voltage data streams as a list of timestamp-value pairs.
- **Query Operations**: Use the provided methods to query statistics (sum, mean, min, max) over a range of timestamps.
- **Customization**: You can customize the time window or the type of query as needed for different applications in power grid load dispatch centers.
